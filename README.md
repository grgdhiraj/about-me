# Résumé
This is a my résumé that I would love to present as my introduction webpage from now onwards. 
I build it using the basics of web development that I have learned from the course as well as from around the different sources around the Internet while seeking for learning and love for minimal yet responsive web design. 

More will be updated as my skills and experience grows on within the web development field as well as in other areas of my professional field and interests.
