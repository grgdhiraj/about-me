# Résumé
This is a my résumé that I would love to present as my introduction webpage, I build using the basics of web development, that I have learned as well as from around the different sources while seeking seeking for learning on minimal yet responsive web design. 

More will be updated as my skills and experience grows on within the web development field as well as in other areas of my professional field and interests.
